4.3 Open [NearIT](https://go.nearit.com), select your app and navigate to “**Settings> Push Settings**”. Upload your *.p12* under the “**Setup iOS push notifications**” block. You will be prompted to enter the password you have chosen previously (chapter 4.2)

### 5) Get the device token

In your app code, ask for the token:

```csharp
public override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication application, NSDictionary launchOptions)
{
    application.RegisterForRemoteNotifications();
}
```

When you get the token, just give it to the SDK:

```csharp
public override void RegisteredForRemoteNotifications(UIApplication application, NSData deviceToken)
{
    NITManager.DefaultManager.SetDeviceTokenWithData(deviceToken);
}
```
