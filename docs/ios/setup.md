# Setup (iOS) #

**NOTE** Make sure that your are using Visual Studio 7.2+

To install NearIT for your iOS component, add all the *.dll* files from the `dlls` folder on our <a href="https://github.com/nearit/Xamarin-SDK/" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. To do that, right-click on “**References>Edit References**”. From the window, select the tab “**References**” and then “**Browse**” to select the *.dll* file.

In the `FinishedLaunching(UIApplication application, NSDictionary launchOptions)` method of your **AppDelegate** class, set the API token to the SDK a String


```csharp
public override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication application, NSDictionary launchOptions)
{
    ...
    NITManager.SetupWithApiKey("<your API token here>");
    ...
}
```

You can find the API key on <a href="https://go.nearit.com/" target="_blank">**NearIT web interface**</a>, under the "**Settings>SDK Integration**" section.

##Manual Configuration Refresh##

The SDK **initialization is done automatically** and handles the task of syncing the recipes with our servers when your app starts up.
<br>However, if you need to sync the recipes configuration more often, you can call this method:

```csharp
NITManager.DefaultManager.RefreshConfigWithCompletionHandler((error) => {
    ...                
});
```

If the *refreshConfig* has succeeded, *error* is **nil**.
